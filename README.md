# California Traffic Collisions
SQL Queries for the California Traffic Collisions dataset.

The `covid_analysis.RMD` file has the R Markdown version of the html notebook `covid_analysis.nb.html`. In the code, I use R and SQL to read the [switrs.sqlite](https://www.kaggle.com/alexgude/california-traffic-collision-data-from-switrs) dataset.

If you wish to run this code you'll need to install the ODBC driver and set up the dataset in your windows machine.
